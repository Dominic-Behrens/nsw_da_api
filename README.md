This is a very simple set of scripts to access the NSW DPHI DA API and clean the data into a data.frame, then do some basic things with it. 

It also includes a second short script to filter the data into only those currently on exhibition (as per the planning portal definitions). 

Finally, it looks if the DA is on planningalerts and makes a shortlist of applications that people might want to comment on.
